**Continuous improvement starts with visibility.** Kaizen analyzes code quality, complexity, and churn to identify technical debt and hotspots in your codebase. It generates health grades, actionable concerns, and interactive visualizations.

---

## Features

- **A-F Health Grades** with 0-100 scores across complexity, maintainability, churn, function size, and code structure
- **Cyclomatic & Cognitive Complexity**, Halstead Metrics, Maintainability Index, and hotspot detection
- **Multi-Language** — Go (native AST), Kotlin & Swift (tree-sitter), Python (stub)
- **Interactive Visualizations** — HTML treemaps, Sankey diagrams, call graphs, terminal charts
- **CI Quality Gate** — blast-radius detection with exit codes for pipelines
- **GitHub PR Action** — automatic PR comments with score deltas, hotspot tracking, and call graph diffs
- **Historical Tracking** — SQLite snapshots with trend analysis and diff reporting
- **Code Ownership** — CODEOWNERS-based team metrics and reports

---

## GitHub Action — PR Analysis

Add Kaizen to any repository to get automatic code quality comments on every pull request.

### Quick Setup

Create `.github/workflows/kaizen.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Kaizen PR Analysis

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  kaizen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: acollie/kaizen@v0.1.0-beta
        with:
          path: "."
          base-branch: main
```

Every PR will receive a comment showing score changes, complexity metrics, and hotspot status. The comment is updated in-place on each push — never duplicated.

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | Directory to analyze | `.` |
| `base-branch` | Branch to compare against | `main` |
| `skip-churn` | Skip git churn analysis for faster runs | `true` |
| `github-token` | GitHub token for posting PR comments | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `fail-on-regression` | Fail the action if the score drops | `false` |
| `languages` | Comma-separated list of languages to include | all |
| `include-callgraph` | Include SVG call graph of changed functions (Go only) | `false` |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `score-delta` | Numeric score change between base and head |
| `grade` | Current grade letter (A-F) |
| `has-concerns` | Whether blast-radius concerns were found |

### Full Example

```yaml
name: Kaizen PR Analysis

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  kaizen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: acollie/kaizen@v0.1.0-beta
        id: kaizen
        with:
          path: "."
          base-branch: main
          skip-churn: "true"
          fail-on-regression: "true"
          languages: "go,kotlin"
          include-callgraph: "true"

      - name: Check results
        run: |
          echo "Score delta: ${{ steps.kaizen.outputs.score-delta }}"
          echo "Grade: ${{ steps.kaizen.outputs.grade }}"
          echo "Has concerns: ${{ steps.kaizen.outputs.has-concerns }}"
```

### What the PR Comment Shows

- **Grade and Score** — overall health grade (A-F) with numeric score out of 100
- **Score Delta** — how much the score changed compared to the base branch
- **Metrics Table** — overall score, average complexity, maintainability, hotspot count, and function count with deltas
- **Hotspot Changes** — new hotspots introduced, hotspots fixed, and persistent hotspots
- **Blast-Radius Warnings** — functions with high fan-in (many callers) that were modified
- **Call Graph** (optional) — SVG artifact showing changed functions and their callers/callees

### Pinning a Version

```yaml
      # Pin to a specific release (recommended)
      - uses: acollie/kaizen@v0.1.0-beta

      # Or track the latest on main (may include breaking changes)
      - uses: acollie/kaizen@main
```

### Using with a Custom Token

The default `${{ github.token }}` works for most cases. If you need to trigger other workflows from the comment, use a Personal Access Token or GitHub App token:

```yaml
      - uses: acollie/kaizen@v0.1.0-beta
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.KAIZEN_TOKEN }}
```

## How It Works

### Architecture

Kaizen uses a modular, language-agnostic architecture:

- **Interface-based language analyzers** — easy to add new languages
- **Tree-sitter AST parsing** — accurate syntax understanding (Kotlin, Swift)
- **Go's `ast` package** — native support for Go analysis
- **SQLite time-series database** — efficient historical tracking
- **Cobra CLI framework** — professional command structure

See [Architecture Guide](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

### Supported Languages

| Language | Status | Parser | Coverage |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Go | Full | go/ast | 95%+ |
| Kotlin | Full | tree-sitter | 90%+ |
| Swift | Full | tree-sitter | 90%+ |
| Python | Stub | tree-sitter | Ready for implementation |

### What It Analyzes

**Per-File**: lines of code, import count, duplication percentage

**Per-Function**: length, parameter count, cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, nesting depth, Halstead metrics, maintainability index, fan-in/fan-out

**Code Health Scoring**:
```
Grade A (90-100):  Excellent - Well-maintained code
Grade B (75-89):   Good     - Minor improvements suggested
Grade C (60-74):   Fair     - Consider refactoring
Grade D (40-59):   Poor     - Significant technical debt
Grade F (0-39):    Critical - Urgent refactoring needed
```

**Automatic Issue Detection**: high complexity (CC > 10), low maintainability (MI < 20), long functions (> 50 lines), deep nesting (> 4 levels), high churn (> 10 commits), hotspots (high complexity + high churn)

### Visualizations

**Interactive Heatmap** — drill-down treemap with color-coded metrics. Color intensity = severity, box size = code volume, click to explore, hover for details.

**Call Graph** — D3.js force-directed graph showing function call relationships. Node size = fan-in, color = complexity. Filter by `--base` to show only changed functions.

**Sankey Diagram** — code ownership flow showing team-to-function dependencies. Flow width = call frequency.

**Terminal Charts** — quick ASCII trend lines without opening a browser.

### Performance

| Project Size | Estimated Time |
|--------------|----------------|
| 10K LOC | ~0.1-0.5s |
| 100K LOC | ~1-3s |
| 1M LOC | ~15-25s |
| 10M+ LOC | ~3-5m |

Use `--skip-churn` to disable git operations (adds 20-40% overhead). Run on SSD for 2-3x faster I/O. Exclude large directories with `.kaizenignore`.
