## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by using GitHub's security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/alexcollie/kaizen/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with details

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, we'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days, we'll provide a detailed response with next steps
- **Fix Timeline**: We aim to release security patches within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

### Security Update Policy

- Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2)
- Critical vulnerabilities may result in immediate releases
- Security advisories will be published on GitHub Security Advisories
- CHANGELOG.md will document all security fixes

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:

1. Report vulnerabilities in good faith
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruption
3. Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary for demonstration
4. Give us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure

Thank you for helping keep Kaizen and its users safe!
